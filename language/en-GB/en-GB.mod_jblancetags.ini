MOD_JBLANCETAGS="JoomBri Tags"
MOD_JBLANCE_DESC_TAGS_MODULE="Module from Joomulus has been modified to show tags from JoomBri Freelance. It allows you to display your site's tags using a Flash movie that rotates them in 3D. It works just like a regular tags cloud, but is more visually exciting. This is an IE6 proof version of Joomulus using user defined tags only. This cuts down on server load and is much more relible. Thanks to Joomulus!"
